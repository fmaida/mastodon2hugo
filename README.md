# Mastodon 2 Hugo

**Enables searchability for your Hugo website on Mastodon. Now, anyone can discover you on Mastodon by simply entering your domain.**

**Requires Python 3.7 or higher**

Why you should care?
--------------------
If you have an account on Mastodon and a website built with Hugo, you can make it possible for people searching for you on Mastodon to find you through your website domain.

#### For example:

Imagine your website is hosted at `https://www.doe.com`, and your username is `johndoe543210@mastodon.world`.

After running this script, recompiling your site with Hugo, and deploying it, people will also be able to search and find you on Mastodon by using `@john@doe.com`.

Actually any name inserted before your domain name will work, as if it is a *catch-all* address. This means that any `@<place your name here>@doe.com` will work as well. If you need to have different names with different destinations, you'll have to write some client-based code in order to redirect Mastodon properly.

How does this work exactly?
---------------------------
Every time someone searches for a user on Mastodon (for example: `@john@doe.com`), the Mastodon server tries to contact the domain (`doe.com`) to ask about user credentials, by accessing a page under `https://doe.com/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:john@doe.com` using a *GET* method.
  
All my script does is copy these credentials from the Mastodon server that is hosting your account, and insert them into your website or blog created with Hugo in order to mimick the same directory structure.

Usage
-----
Download the python script `mastodon2hugo.py` in the root directory
of your Hugo project, then enter this command from a terminal:

```sh
python mastodon2hugo.py <your mastodon account>
```

If the script completes successfully, you should find a file 
called `webfinger` inside the directory `static/.well-known/`. 
That file will contain a JSON object with the proper configuration 
for your website.

**In order to make your changes effective, after running my script please remember to execute Hugo to build your website again and deploy.**

Usage examples
--------------
1. `python mastodon2hugo.py @johndoe@mastodon.online`
2. `python mastodon2hugo.py @gohugoio@fosstodon.org`

For example, if your Hugo project is named `mywebsite`, you should have 
the `mastodon2hugo.py` script inside the root directory like this:

```sh
$ cd mywebsite
$ ls -l
